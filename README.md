## Introduction
This project is a sample Node.js Backend project that demonstrates how to connect to **MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL, Kafka, and RabbitMQ.** It demonstrates how these services can be used and interact with each other in a Node.js application.

Additionally, the project demonstrates how to use the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging, as well as how to implement a round-robin load balancing algorithm using Redis.

And we call this the **NMRPKER-Stack**! ðŸš€

## Features

### MongoDB
- **MongoDB**: The project connects to a MongoDB database and performs CRUD operations.
  - **Aggregation**: The project demonstrates how to use MongoDB's aggregation framework to perform complex queries, such as:
    - Grouping data by a field.
    - Filtering data based on a condition (lookup, match, project, etc.)
    - Sorting data.
    - Unwinding arrays.

### Redis-Mongo-Flow
- **Redis-Mongo-Flow**: The project also demonstrates how to use Redis as a cache layer for MongoDB.
  - This is done by first checking if the data exists in Redis. 
  - If it does, the data is retrieved from Redis. 
  - If it doesn't, the data is retrieved from MongoDB and stored in Redis.
  - This is done to reduce the number of queries to the database, thereby reducing the load on the database.

### RabbitMQ
- **RabbitMQ**: The project also demonstrates how to connect to RabbitMQ and publish and consume messages.
  - The project uses RabbitMQ to publish a message and consume it.
  - The message is published to a queue and consumed by a consumer.
  - This is done to demonstrate how to use RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication between services.

### Apache Kafka
- **Apache Kafka**: The project also demonstrates how to connect to Apache Kafka and produce and consume messages.
  - The project uses Apache Kafka to produce a message and consume it.
  - The message is produced to a topic and consumed by a consumer.
  - This is done to demonstrate how to use Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming.

### Round-Robin Load Balancing Algorithm
- **Round-Robin Load Balancing Algorithm**: The project also demonstrates how to use Redis to implement round-robin load balancing.
  - The project has two routes, `/api/test/route1` and `/api/test/route2`.
  - The project uses Redis to store the number of requests to each route.
  - The project uses round-robin load balancing to distribute the requests evenly between the two routes.

### ELK Stack
- **ELK Stack**: The project also demonstrates how to use the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging.
  - The project uses Logstash to parse the log messages and send them to Elasticsearch.
  - Elasticsearch will then index the log messages for searching and analysis.
  - (Optional) You can also enhance the project by using Kibana to visualize the log data.

```

## Getting Started
To **get started**, run the following commands:

1. Start the MongoDB service:
    ```bash
    brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
    ```

2. Start the Redis service:
    ```bash
    redis-server
    ```
   
3. Start the RabbitMQ service:
    ```bash
    brew services start rabbitmq
    ```
   
3. `cd` into the project directory:
    ```bash
   cd node-mongo-redis-project
   ```
   
4. Start the Node.js server:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
   
5. (Optional) Test the RabbitMQ service by publishing a message (go to another terminal window):
    ```bash
    node publish.js
    ```
   Verify that the message is received by the consumer by going to the terminal that is running the Node.js server (the one you started the index.js script).
   You should receive the following messages in the terminal:
   ```bash
    Server running on port 5000
    Visit http://localhost:5000/ to test the connection.
    Redis Connected
    MongoDB Connected
    Redis Test: Hello from Redis
    Kafka Producer and Consumer Connected
    RabbitMQ Connected
    Aggregation result: [
    { _id: 'Frank', totalOrderValue: 60 },
    { _id: 'David', totalOrderValue: 100 },
    { _id: 'Charlie', totalOrderValue: 35 },
    { _id: 'Grace', totalOrderValue: 75 },
    { _id: 'Alice', totalOrderValue: 50 },
    { _id: 'Bob', totalOrderValue: 80 },
    { _id: 'Ivy', totalOrderValue: 55 },
    { _id: 'Eve', totalOrderValue: 45 },
    { _id: 'Helen', totalOrderValue: 90 }
    ]
    [*] Waiting for messages in task_queue. To exit press CTRL+C
    [x] Received 'This is a test message!'
    ```
   
6. Visit [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) to test the connection. Also test the routes by visiting the following URLs: [http://localhost:5000/api/test/route1](http://localhost:5000/api/test/route1) and [http://localhost:5000/api/test/route2](http://localhost:5000/api/test/route2).

7. (Optional) Test the Round-Robin Load Balancing Algorithm:
    ```bash
    cd round-robin
    node index.js
    ```
   
8. (Optional) Test the ELK Stack:
    ```bash
    cd elk-stack
    node index.js
    ```
